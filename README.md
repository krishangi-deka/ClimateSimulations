# ClimateSimulations
This project uses geo-spatial modeling to simulate sea-level rise. It shows what six meters of difference(sea-level rise) might look like across the world.
I worked on this project with [William Staudenmeier](https://github.com/WilliamStaudenmeier), who is a very experienced and learned Data Scientist. 

### Six meters of difference!
Did you know that climatologists are beginning to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to fine tune their climate models? According to one such model by [NOAA: National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/), the world's [sea level](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/slr.html) could rise by as much as six meters in the next 80 years as a result of global warming.

From an R programming perspective, the #elevatr package has been used to pull geospatial data for any lat/long coordinates in the world and #rayshader package to simulate different scenarios.
